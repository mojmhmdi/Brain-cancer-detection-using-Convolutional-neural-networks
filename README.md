# Brain-cancer-detection-using-Convolutional-neural-networs

Repository description: 

-This repository includes the python code for the brain tumor MRI image detection using convolutional neural netwotks. 
you can download the data set from the following link: 
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13n6xLWZ5PpRgtG-iwhfiAZXh4ZXKF-8p?usp=sharing  
After downloading the dataset, save it in the same directory as the codes (keep the name of the folfor as it is).

How to run the code: 
open a terminal in the directory where the code is stored and run the following command: python main.py

dataset description: 
the dataset includes 253 MRI images of brain categorized in two lasses: 
1- brain with tumor 
2- normal brain

The images are stored in the following directory: 
-imges of brain with tumor: brain_tumor_dataset\yes 
-images of normal brain: brain_tumor_dataset\no

files description: 
-methods.py is the file that contains the methods used to preprocess the images. 
-cnn_based_nodel.py is the file that contains the CNN model. 
-the directory brain_tumor_dataset contains the images
